## Project Description

Name of Project: Foster-Bray Website

Project’s Purpose or Goal: Rebuilding the website for a small contracting business based in Issaquah, Washington.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
1. Site is deployed to a hosting service.
2. Successfully incorporates routing via the React-Router library
3. Displays vendors and offered products and links to the appropriate site when clicked.
4. Has a contact form that sends an email when submitted.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

1. NPM
2. ReactJS
3. Redux-React
4. React-Router
5. CSS
6. Sketch
7. JavaScript
8. Ruby? (Will research incorporating a basic database for storing product data)


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

1. I will add basic animations to increase the professionalism of the site.
   - underlining links on hover
   - slide down animation on click of vendor to show products
2. I will work on adding Google Analytics to the page and setting it up for the client.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

1. Google Analytics
2. If I am able to, I would like to create a basic database in Ruby and create my own api call to retrieve product data.

Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?

The website will be fairly basic, as that's what the client asked for. So I will focus on making my code as dry as possible while implementing industry best practices.


## Research Done Today (7/13/18)

- Intro to create-react-app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCz3rhsDG5s
- Watched max amount of allowed egghead.io videos on implementing react-router into CRA project
- Read https://medium.com/@adamrackis/composing-reusable-components-in-react-de44d862fe5a for more info on  reusable components
- Research react-collapse (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-collapse) as I will have many collapsing elements on my page
- Read article on deploying create-react-app https://medium.com/@timmykko/deploying-create-react-app-with-nginx-and-ubuntu-e6fe83c5e9e7

I feel like i gained a lot of good insight into what I need to prepare for in the coming weeks regarding the animations and other features i want to add.
